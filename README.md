#### Community structure of associative memory encoding (LAM) - WORK-IN-PROGRESS
Abstract: *An extended network model for graph-based hierarchical computation, generating communities (clusters) of associative links between memory items, with scale regulated by the heterogenous modulation of inhibitory circuits.*

[Multiscale representations of community structures in attractor neural networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412329/pdf/pcbi.1009296.pdf) (2021)

- Arbitary symmetrical graphs; generalise the one-dimensional sequential structure of temporal associations of the conventional hopfield model
- Negative associated weights; assembly specific inhibition

### Concept
Graph-based segmentation and clustering;

- Chunking of items
    - Increasing the number of items retained in the limited capacity of working memory
- Segmentation of images & words
    - Learning and comprehension of scenes/language
- Temporal abstraction of repeated sequences
    - Accelerate reinforcement learning

### What is the neurological representation?
- Having experienced a seqence of events, the brain, learns the temporal associations between the successive events and captures the structure of a state-transition graph
- Event segmentation performed by humans reflects community structures (clusters)
- Characteristics of place cells and entorhinal grid cells
- Asymmetrical links generate chunked sequential activities in the hippocampus

### Research questions?
- How strong is the relationship between hebbian learning, state attractors and sequential segmentation with the hippocampus?
