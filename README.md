#### Laplacian Associative Memory (LAM)
Abstract: *An extended attractor network model for graph-based hierarchical computation, generating multiscale representations for communities (clusters) of associative links between memory items, and the scale is regulated by the heterogenous modulation of inhibitory circuits.*

#### WORK-IN-PROGRESS

++ Concept<br>
Attractor dynamics of recurrent neural circuits offer a biologically plausiable for hierarchical segmentation.
Relationship between attrator networks and the graph-theoretic processing of knowledge structures.

- Chunking of items; increasing no. of items retained in limited capacity of working memory
- Segmentation of words; learning and comprehension of language
- Temporal abstraction of repeated sequences; accelerates reinforcement learning
